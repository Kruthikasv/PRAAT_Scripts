# PRAAT Scripts

## Overview

The PRAAT Scripts project is a collection of scripts designed to automate various tasks in PRAAT, a software application used for phonetic analysis of speech sounds. These scripts help streamline the workflow for speech analysis, making it easier to perform repetitive tasks, analyze large datasets, and extract meaningful insights from audio data.

## Features

- **Automated Analysis**: Scripts to automate common tasks in PRAAT, such as segmenting audio, extracting pitch, formants, and other acoustic features.
- **Batch Processing**: Capability to process multiple audio files in a single run.
- **Customization**: Easily customizable scripts to suit specific analysis needs.
- **Efficiency**: Significant reduction in time and effort required for manual analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Scripting Language**: PRAAT scripting language

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- PRAAT software (latest version)

### Steps

1. **Download PRAAT**
   - Download and install PRAAT from the official website: [PRAAT Download](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kruthikasv/PRAAT_Scripts.git
   ```

3. **Configure PRAAT**
   - Open PRAAT.
   - Navigate to the directory where the scripts are located.

## Usage

### Running a Script

1. **Open PRAAT**: Launch PRAAT on your computer.
2. **Load a Script**: Open the script you want to run from the PRAAT Scripts directory.
3. **Execute the Script**: Follow the instructions within the script to execute it. This may involve selecting audio files, setting parameters, and running the analysis.

### Common Scripts

1. **Pitch Extraction**
   - Script to extract pitch contours from audio files.
   - Usage: Load the script and select the audio files to process. The script will output pitch data.

2. **Formant Analysis**
   - Script to analyze formant frequencies.
   - Usage: Load the script and select the audio files. The script will extract and display formant information.

3. **Segmentation**
   - Script to automate the segmentation of audio files into phonetic units.
   - Usage: Load the script and select the audio files. The script will segment the audio based on specified criteria.

### Customization

- **Modify Scripts**: Open the script file in a text editor and make changes to the parameters or logic as needed.
- **Create New Scripts**: Use the existing scripts as a template to create new scripts for specific analysis tasks.
